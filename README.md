## Ride Sharing App
 sharing is a great way to reduce the waste and create extra value for the society. Unlike Uber or Lyft, Ride Sharing is completely community driven and it aims to fill the gap where Uber and Lyft could not cover, that is city to city travel.
 
## Summerary of Ride Sharing App
  Sharing Ride aims to provide a platform for people to post their upcoming inter cities/state travel ahead of time so people who wants to go to the same destination can share the ride together. When a member found a match, he/she can start instant chat with the host to get more infomation about this upcoming trip.
